# Core values

Theoretically, these values do not depend on any truth about the world we live in

- Preserve **my identity** as much as possible

    **My Identity** are all the things that I like about me that makes me who I am (My idealized self), and it breaks the boundaries of my own physical body. My family is also part of who I am but in a lesser extent. The same goes for friends, strangers, living beings, and non-living things too. But also the things that made us.

    I think as things get emotionally farther, the less I consider them to be **me**.

    This is probably a reaction to the fear of dying.

- Reduce suffering

# Sub-Values

Values that are a consequence of my [Core Values](#core-values) and the way the physical world works

- Maximize people's values, as long as they don't conflict with a common shared values

    As a society have we ever defined these **shared values** in a cristal clear way?.\
    I'm not sure what the differences are among countries.\
    Shouldn't congresses around the world vote about this?, Do they do it and I'm just ignorant?\
    I don't even know the values of the societies I am part of, I should know this!

- Improve, improve, improve! (But improve what?)
- Equal oportunities among humans (redundant?)
- Knowledge
- Intelligence

# Biases

Like [Sub-Values](#sub-values) but applies when in doubt (high uncertainty) about the physical world, so these values may be wrong and might change in the future if more knowledge is gathered or dynamics of the physical world change. But I have a strong enough opinion to put them here

- Democracy
- I value honesty, but mostly I hate perverse social dynamics that requires me to lie in order to succeed (I hate this so hard!) and I love to incentivize situations where honesty emerges as a social dynamic consequence. So I'm sympathetic to other people that lie under the burden of perversive social dynamics
