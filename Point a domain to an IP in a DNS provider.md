# Point a domain to an IP in a DNS provider

I used an **A Record** to point a domain (e.g. [example.com](example.com)) to an IPv4, and a **CNAME Record** to point a subdomain (e.g. [www.example.com](www.example.com)) to the same IPv4 as the root domain

This is how it looks in Namecheap's interface
